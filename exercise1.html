    <h1>Mariya's homework</h1>
    <p>1. Update code from previous homework (updating and logging employee summary) to use a function. Write a function, that will accept employee object as a function argument and log employee summary in the console, the same way you did it last time. This should fairly easy with minimal changes to your initial code.
        Save your function as HTML file (exercise1.html).</p>
    <script>
        let employee = {
        name: 'Mohammad',
        age: 17,
        location: 'New York',
        paycheckHistory: [
        {
            month: 'August',
            amount: 2000
        },
        {
            month: 'September',
            amount: 1000
        }
        ]
        };
        // exercise1

        // option1(function declaration):
        function log(employee) {
            console.log(`${employee.name} is ${employee.age} years old,
            lives in New York and his last paycheck was ${employee.paycheckHistory[1].amount}.`)
        }
        log(employee);
        
        employee.age +=1;
        employee.paycheckHistory[1].amount=3000;
        log(employee);
        
        
        // option2(function expression):
        let employeeSum = function(employee) {
            console.log(`${employee.name} is ${employee.age} years old,
            lives in New York and his last paycheck was ${employee.paycheckHistory[1].amount}.`)
        }
        employeeSum(employee);
        
        employee.age +=1;
        employee.paycheckHistory[1].amount=3000;
        employeeSum(employee);
        
        
        // option3(arrow function):
        let employeeSummary1 = (employee) => {
            console.log(`${employee.name} is ${employee.age} years old,
            lives in New York and his last paycheck was ${employee.paycheckHistory[1].amount}.`)
        }
        employeeSummary1(employee);
        
        employee.age +=1;
        employee.paycheckHistory[1].amount=3000;
        employeeSummary1(employee);
